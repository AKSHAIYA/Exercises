Time complexity
1)Time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. 
2)Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, 
supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform.

Time complexity of replace function is O(n^2)

Space Complexity
Space complexity is the amount of memory used by the algorithm (including the input values to the algorithm) to execute and produce the result.
